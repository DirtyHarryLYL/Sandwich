Sandwich is a project for general human activity understanding. It consists of:
- A novel structured semantic space to reexplain all the action classes from existing action datasets of multiple modalities.
- A large-scale multi-modal action database aggregating a plenty of existing action datasets.
- A bidirectional mapping system to learn the bi-mapping between human action physical-semantic space.

Under construction. More contents are coming soon!.
