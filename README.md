Sandwich is a project for general human activity understanding. It consists of:
- A novel structured semantic space to re-explain all the action classes from existing action datasets of multiple modalities.
- A large-scale multi-modal action database, **Pangea**, aggregating a plenty of existing action datasets.
- A bidirectional mapping system to learn the bi-mapping between human action physical-semantic space and facilitate the action recognition and generation.

#### We are gathering more and more human action datasets and linking their label systems to Pangea (CVPR 2024), for more details please refer to this [page](https://github.com/DirtyHarryLYL/Sandwich/tree/main/semantic_alignment). 
- Given our new hierarchical semantic system, you can train big models on all action datasets under ONE label system with principled knowledge! 

Under construction. More content is coming soon!
